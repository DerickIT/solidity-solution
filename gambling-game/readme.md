- This is a decentralized gambling game smart contract implemented in Solidity. The contract, named `GamblingGame`, allows users to place bets on various outcomes and automatically distributes rewards based on the results.

## Functionality Overview

1. Betting System: Users can place bets on four different outcomes - Big, Small, Single, or Double.

2. Game Rounds: Each game round has a specific duration measured in blocks.

3. Token-based Betting: The game uses an ERC20 token (e.g., USDT) for placing bets and distributing rewards.

4. Automated Reward Distribution: Winners are automatically determined and rewarded based on the game results.

5. Owner Controls: The contract owner can adjust certain parameters like game duration and betting token.

## Architecture Design

The contract is built using several key components:

1. Inheritance:
   - Initializable: Allows the contract to be upgradeable
   - OwnableUpgradeable: Implements ownership functionality
   - ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable: Protects against reentrancy attacks

2. State Variables:
   - betteToken: The ERC20 token used for betting
   - gameBlock: Duration of each game round in blocks
   - hgmGlobalId: Unique identifier for each game round
   - roundGameInfo: Stores information about each game round
   - guessBettorList: List of all bets placed

3. Key Structs:
   - RoundGame: Stores information about each game round
   - GuessBettor: Represents a single bet with all relevant information

4. Main Functions:
   - initialize: Sets up the initial state of the contract
   - createBettor: Allows users to place bets
   - luckyDraw: Determines the winners and distributes rewards

5. Access Control:
   - onlyOwner modifier for owner-specific functions
   - onlyLuckyDrawer modifier for the lucky draw function

6. Events:
   - GuessBettorCreate: Emitted when a new bet is placed
   - AllocateRward: Emitted when rewards are distributed

## Key Features

1. Randomness: The game results are determined by an external "lucky drawer", which helps ensure fairness.

2. Flexible Betting: Users can bet on multiple outcomes (Big, Small, Single, Double).

3. Automatic Payouts: Winning bets are automatically paid out after each round.

4. Upgradability: The contract is designed to be upgradeable, allowing for future improvements.

5. Security Measures: 
   - ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
   - SafeERC20 for secure token transfers
   - Access control for critical functions

6. Transparency: All bet information and game results are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.

This smart contract provides a robust foundation for a decentralized gambling game, with features to ensure fairness, security, and transparency. It can be further expanded or integrated into a larger decentralized application ecosystem.
